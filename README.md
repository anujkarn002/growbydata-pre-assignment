 3. [Mvitals](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=health.sunya.individual) is one of the projects that I have worked with and am most proud of. It is a subscription-based app that can calculate users vital signs in just a minute by continuously reading users face, not only that but the web dashboard shows interactive charts and graphs relating to users health data history and summarizes the data briefing users about abnormalities. The app is not only for an individual, but an organization or group that would like to track their employees or members health data. It is special to me because I have worked mostly independently as well as after hours. I didn't have all the skills that were required but as needed I learned them and referencing industrial best practices I have implemented the best solution possible.
